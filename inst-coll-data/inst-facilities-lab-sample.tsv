BGBM	https://www.grid.ac/institutes/grid.507655.4	BGBM Laboratories	SEM (Scanning electron microscopy) - Hitachi SU-8010 FE-SEM 	The Service Area Laboratories and its staff provide a high-end work-flow-based environment for research projects dealing with evolution, diversity and systematics of plants, lichens and diatoms. Spread over two locations, the laboratory facilities cover approximately 450 m2. Institutionally, the Service Area Laboratories is affiliated on one side to the Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum, Berlin, and on the other side to the Borsch Group in Institute of Biology, Systematic Botany and Geography of Plants. Both institutions are part of the Freie Universität Berlin. The activities of the laboratory facility located in the Botanical Museum (Königin-Luise-Str. 6-8), mainly focus on Genome- and DNA-analyses (including barcoding), micromorphology and ultra-sculpture of botanical surfaces and the cultivation of diatoms. A field emission scanning electron microscope (FE-SEM) is available. The activities of the laboratory facility located in the Botanical Institute (Altensteinstr. 6) mainly focus on DNA/RNA analyses related to population genetics and genome sizing using flow cytometry. In addition, the facility is equipped with a S1-area for cloning purposes.
